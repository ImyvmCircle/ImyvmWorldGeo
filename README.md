# IMYVMWorldGeo 1.21 1.0.1

## Changelog 1.0.1

This is a version mainly aimed to improve api functions and behavior.
- API:Make RegionDataApi focused on data access and database operations only.
- Region Creation: ID generator improved to avoid conflicts and contains more information.
- Scope Modification: allow insert point by one click and delete point.

## Introduction

This is a mod to provide a geography system framework for Imyvm server players and groups, which is a basement for jungle system, community system and so on.

## Environment Requirements

This mod is **server-side only** and requires the following environment:

- **Minecraft Version:** 1.21  
- **Fabric Loader Version:** 0.16.9 (or compatible with Minecraft 1.21)  
- **Fabric API:** Required  
- **Fabric Kotlin:** Required  
- **Java Version:** 21  
- **IMYVM Hoki Mod Version:** 1.1.4

> Note: Client-side players do not need to install this mod, but the server must meet these requirements.

## Installation

1. **Download the mod jar**  
   Download the latest `imyvm-world-geo` jar file from the release page or build it from source.

2. **Install Fabric Loader on your server**  
   Ensure the server runs Fabric Loader compatible with Minecraft 1.21.

3. **Install Fabric API and Fabric Kotlin**  
   Download the corresponding Fabric API and Fabric Kotlin jars and place them into the server's `mods` folder:
   - [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)  
   - [Fabric Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)

4. **Install Imyvm Hoki mod**  
   This mod depends on Imyvm fork of Hoki, another ImyvmCircle project. Download the latest Hoki jar from [GitHub](https://github.com/ImyvmCircle/Hoki) and place it in the server's `mods` folder.

5. **Add Imyvm World Geo mod jar**  
   Place the `imyvm-world-geo` jar into the server's `mods` folder. 

6. **Start the server**  
   Run the server normally. The mod will automatically load along with its dependencies.

## Usage

- This mod provides region and scope management commands for server. All commands are executed on the server side and require the player to have the appropriate permissions.  
- For extensions, apis are provided in `src/main/kotlin/com/imyvm/iwg/inter/api` folder.

> For detailed commands and API usage, see the `Command` and `API` sections in this README.
